# Mine-imator Keyframe Maker (WIP)

A software to create [Mine-imator](https://github.com/stuffbydavid/Mine-imator) keyframes without actually using the program.

## Demo

It does not have any fancy features at the moment, but here is a demo of what I have made until this time.

The above keyframes are generated by these two lines of code:

```csharp
mikf.Add(0, right_arm);
mikf.Add(24, right_arm, new Values(ROT_X: 30, BEND_ANGLE_X: 30));
```

Which make the character rotate its arm 30˚ while bending it 30˚.

## Roadmap

- Add a feature to convert a video file to frames and make UI for people to pick points from it

- Maybe add motion capture?

miKeyframes.AddKeyframe(miKeyframes.MakeKeyframe(24, values: new Values(POS_X: 50, POS_Y: 0, POS_Z: 0, ROT_Z: 50)));
```
